Description: Tidy, analyze, and plot directed acyclic graphs for 
    Diagnostic Classification Modeling (DCM). 'ggdcm' is built on 
    top of 'ggdag' and 'dagitty', R packages that use the 'DAFitty'
    web tool (<http://dagitty.net>) for creating and analyzing DAGs.
    'ggdcm' makes it easy to tidy and plot 'dagitty' objects using 
    'ggplot2' and 'ggraph', as well as common analytic and graphical
    functions, such as determing adjustment sets and node relationships.
